/*for those of you who are reading the list of questions, here is how the listOfQuestions object is created:

Type: 'normal' or 'in order'; 'normal' means that the choices will be rearranged. 'in order' means that choices will be in order for some particular reasons (i.e. "all of the above" questions)

Difficulty: Listed from 1-3.
1 = Easy
2 = Medium
3 = Hard

The 'category' property will be used to filter out certain questions, depending on what the user wants to take the quiz on.

The 'explanation' property, as its name implies, would show the explanation when the user wants to go over any of the questions. A "C" on the explanation property will mean that the question is pretty much common sense, and no explanation will be provided.

This .js file is used simply for storage of questions. Feel free to edit any of the questions if needed. To look at the actual game code, go to game.js.
