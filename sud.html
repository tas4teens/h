            <p class = 'example'>
                You just finished your fourth period class, and you are ready to get some lunch. You enter the restroom to wash your hands, and to your disbelief, you find a couple of your friends hanging out in there, with plastic sticks in their mouth. The air is cloudy with mist from these 'sticks'.
                <br><br>
                <b>"What are you guys doing?"</b>  you ask.
                <br><br>
                One of your friends takes the stick out of his mouth. You notice something seems off about him. "Well, my brother just came home from college, he gave some to me. 'Try these', he told me. 'They feel great.' I'm curious so we're vaping them right now. Want to try one with us?" <!--state that they are shared-->
                <br><br>
                You are a little hesitant, so you politely decline.
                <br><br>
                'Come on!' another of your friends insist. 'My brother told us that these e-cigarettes are safer than normal cigarettes! It's a great way for us to look cool and hook up on the latest trend. It's perfectly legal as well! Everyone else is doing it around school too.'
                <br><br>
                You remember the anti-vape ads you always see while watching YouTube. You recall that they are as dangerous as normal cigarettes, as they contain formaldehyde and other metals that may cause cancer.  Again, you don't feel comfortable, so you say 'Sorry, I've got to go eat my lunch.'
                <br><br>
                Your friends don't like this. They shout threats at you as you leave the bathroom. A couple of them tease that they won't be your friend if you don't vape with them...
            </p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>This is just one example of an ongoing epidemic of substance use among adolescents. Not only vapes, but also other substances, such as alcohol and marijuana, are used . <b>This website intends to raise awareness about substance use in adolescents, as substance use may develop into addiction later.</b></p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Substance use</b>, as its name implies, is when an individual uses substances, such as alcohol, marijuana, or some other illicit drug. <a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/substance-use" class = 'citations'><sup>[1]</sup></a> <b>Substance use disorders</b> (also known as SUD, substance abuse, or "drug addiction"), is a behavioral condition that may be caused by substance use, where an individual uses a particular substance uncontrollably, despite having harmful consequences. These substances can range from everyday things like alcohol and tobacco, to illicit drugs such as methamphetamine and heroin. Oftentimes, these individuals are aware that what they are doing to their body is destructive, but they can't stop using these substances. <!--why?-->Usually, their quality of life gets affected in a negative way, as well. <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/addiction" class = 'citations'><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="https://mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/symptoms-causes/syc-20365112" class = 'citations'><sup>[3]</sup></a><br></p>

            <p class = 'imageSubTitle'>Usually, people who struggle with substance use disorders struggle to quit, despite knowing that it is harmful.</p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>It is important to know that <b>there is a difference between substance use and substance use disorders.</b> A couple of examples of people who have experienced substance use is as follows:</p>
                <li class = 'list'>Alex decided to stay after school one day and vape, just for the fun of it. He thought that everyone around him was doing it, so it probably meant no harm.</li><br>
                <li class = 'list'>Kyle's friend offered him marijuana, stating that 'it's what cool people do.' Kyle accepted it and smoked marijuana with his friend after school that day.</li><br>
                <li class = 'list'>James was busy studying for a final exam.He didn't think he would perform well, so he took some pills he got from a stranger, hoping that it will boost his performance.</li>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>The danger here is, <b>each of these individuals' experience with substance use may develop into substance use disorders.</b>  For example, Kyle may have thought that marijuana made him feel extremely good, so he asked his friend for more. Pretty soon, he was asking his friend every day, and his friend got tired of it. One day, his friend told him to "buy your own marijuana." Devastated but desperate for the drug at the same time, he began stealing his parents money and left the house for extended periods of time to smoke it. <br><br>As you can see, kyle's initial encounter with substance use developed into an uncontrollable urge to use an substance, going as far as stealing his parents' money.  Extreme examples of people with <b>substance use disorders*</b> is as follows: </p>

            <li class = 'list'>Andrew is a high school junior who vapes. He is in a critical moment of college planning, but he uses all of his free time vaping with his friends. When he is in class, he cannot concentrate on what is being taught, and his mind is always on vaping. One day, when his parents found his vaping tools and took them away, he became violent.</li><br>
            <li class = 'list'>James is in 12th grade. He illegally smokes marijuana with his friends everday, after school. He usually comes home high, and does nothing around the house. All he cares about during the day is marijuana, causing him to not pay attention in class. He doesn't do his homework either, potentially preventing him from entering college due to failing classes.</li>

            <div class = 'example'>
                <p class = 'summary'>Summary</p>
                Substance use is when a user injects, consumes, or inhales an addictive substance, such as drugs. Substance use can lead to addiction, which is known as substance use disorder* (SUD).
                <br><br>
                *To find out whether one may have a substance use disorder, go to the <a href="#dsm5" class = 'citations'>Diagnosis of SUD</a> section.
            </div>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>What you just read were extreme examples. Notice that in the first example, Andrew cannot control his vaping; he is always thinking of it during class and uses <i>all</i> his free time for vaping. With James, his use of marijuana affected his quality of life in a bad way, where he becomes lazy all the time and not doing his homework. Both of them have uncontrollable urges to use the substance.</p>

            <hr>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>People with substance use disorders typically go through a cycle. According to the New England Journal of Medicine has divided the cycle of those who are struggling with substance use disorders go through into 3 stages: <b>intoxication</b>, <b>withdrawal</b>, and <b>anticipation.</b><sup><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1511480" class = 'citations'>[4]</a></sup> <br><br> <b>Intoxication. </b> Many substances, when consumed or injected, elicit a pleasurable effect. The dopamine (a hormone that is associated with pleasure) levels are increased in your brain, making you feel excellent! For example, when marijuana is smoked or consumed, individuals may feel relaxed, euphoric, creative, or hungry.<sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-does-it-feel-like-to-be-high" class = 'citations'>[5]</a></sup>Cocaine users also state that they feel euphoric, extremely confident, and sociable. <sup><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-does-cocaine-high-feel-like-21988" class = 'citations'>[6]</a></sup> This is a phenomenon known as getting 'high.' <br><br> <b>Withdrawal and negative effect.</b> This is where things get kind of ugly. After this initial high wears off, the individual enters a dysphoric state, where individuals may feel irritated, depressed, or other negative thoughts. This dysphoric state is fueled by stress related hormones, such as corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF), making the individual experience heightened sensitivity to stress. Dopamine levels drop sharply in the brain, exposing the brain to much less dopamine then it was exposed to a few moments ago. All these effects combined make this second stage extremely uncomfortable and unpleasurable to be in. <br><br> <b>Anticipation. </b>In order to get relief from this terrible dysphoric state, the individual may start to crave the substance again, because he remembers how great it felt the first time he tried it. He starts thinking where or how he can get the substance again. If he can get his hands onto the substance, he may consume or inject it, entering the intoxication stage, and the cycle repeats.</p>

            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5779423/pexels-photo-5779423.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500" alt="" class = 'image'>
            <p class = 'imageSubTitle'>Looks good, right? As you sometimes crave food, people struggling with SUD crave the substance that they are using.</p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>It is important to clarify here that <b>a certain substance can have different effects on different people.</b> For example, let's imagine a hypothetical situation where you and your friend smoke marijuana together. You two have very different effects; your friend thinks its extremely pleasant and he feels sedated and calm, while you complain that it's making you hallucinate, feel panic and paranoia, and feel like you want to vomit. <sup><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/what-does-it-feel-like-to-be-high" class = 'citations'></a>[5]</sup> This is still a risk, because first-time users may think that the horrible effect of that drug happened because it was the first time they took it, and therefore think that taking the drug a second time will produce a better result (which it wouldn't).</p>

            <div class = 'example'>
                <p class = 'summary'>Summary</p>
                The 3 stages of SUD are intoxication (substance enters the body and user feels good), withdrawal (the effect of the substance wear off), and anticipation (when the user craves). Certain substances have different effects on different people.

            <section id = 'why' class = 'subtitle'>Why is substance use so harmful?</section>
            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Substance use is harmful because it can develop into substance use disorders, which is more severe.</b> Let's take a look at an example from the "what is substance use, and how does it work?" section.</p>

            <p class = 'quote'>"Alex decided to stay after school one day and vape, just for the fun of it. He thought that everyone around him was doing it, so it probably meant no harm."</p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>Now, this describes Alex experiencing substance use. How may this develop into substance use disorders? Well, let's say Alex feels extremely euphoric after vaping, and wants that experience again. He starts to develop an uncontrollable urge to vape after school, as he knew he couldn't vape when his parents were home. He would often lie and give an excuse to his parents, saying things like "I have a project to work on with my friend, so ill be home late", to keep his parents from questioning the time he would come home. Throughout the day, he cannot pay attention in class and his mind is on what kind of excuse he would give to his parents, and also how much fun he would have after school. Eventually, he started vaping so much that he started to steal them. <br><br> As you can see, Alex's initial encounter with substance use lead him to get addicted to that substance. (Remember, "addiction" means the same as "substance use disorder.") When someone is addicted to the substance, he or she goes repeatedly goes through a cycle (explained in the "what is substance use, and how does it work?" section.) We will discuss the effects of this cycle below.</p>

                <p class = 'summary'>Summary</p>
                Substance use may lead to substance use disorders.

            <p class = 'bodyText'>When the brain is constantly exposed to the same reward over and over again (in this case the 'high' that the substance induces), your body starts responding when it detects something that may deliver the reward, by making you feel nervous, excited, or agitated. For example, let's create another hypothetical situation where you use marijuana with your friend all the time in the school bathrooms. When exposed to the 'high' of marijuana so many times, you may start to feel a bit of 'anticipation' when you 1) see your friend's house, 2) smell marijuana, or 3) pass by the school bathrooms. Because the brain 'predicts' that the reward will be delivered, this can trigger a huge craving for a particular substance. <b>The constant exposure to these cravings is one of the reasons why substance use is so hard to quit.</b></p>

            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/10/10/18/40/news-1729539__340.jpg" alt="computer" class = 'image'>
            <p class = 'imageSubTitle'>Think of a substance like a new computer. It is great at first, but as it is used more and more, it starts to wear down and doesn't do its "job" well.</p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'>When a substance is used repeatedly, it also renders the brain to be less 'rewarded' by stimuli that others would find rewarding. When an individual uses a substance for the first time, he achieves a certain level of euphoria. However, as he constantly repeats his use, the level of euphoria he achieves starts to come down, and more of the substance is needed to get the initial amount of euphoria he achieved on his first hit. Some substances may even cross the line and, after so many hits, elicit a dysphoric feeling instead of a 'high'. Think about it as a brand new computer - when you first start using it, it's very fast and reliable, but after using it so many times, it may start slowing down and be a big pain. <b>It is important to know that these changes cannot be reversed easily.</b></p>

            <p class = 'bodyText'><b>The connection with the dysphoric state.</b> The dysphoric state feels horrible, as we mentioned above. Individuals are more sensitive to stress, and they feel irritable due to the lower amounts of dopamine in the brain. Therefore, an individual may use this substance to get himself out of the dysphoric state. Remember, keep in mind that the individual is perhaps desperate to get out of this dysphoric state. If the individual cannot get his hands upon the substance for some reason, he may hit a point where he would do anything to get the drug. Let's think about this like a famine - for example, there is a severe shortage of food in your country. After tolerating a minimal amount of food for a quite a while, most of us will perhaps reach a 'breaking point' where we would do anything to obtain more food, such as selling expensive things, violently protesting, etc... The same thing can be said for drugs as well; many individuals may go to the point of verbally or physically abusing family members, using the family or relatives' money to order drugs online, or selling their own bodies, in an attempt to get more of the drug. <b>Therefore, substance use is not only harmful to the individual's own body, but it is also harmful to people around him.</b><sup><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmra1511480" class = 'citations'>[4]</a></sup></p>

            <div class = 'example'>
                <p class = 'summary'>Summary</p>
                Constant exposure ot the 'high' can induce cravings. <br><br>
                The danger of substance use is that repeated exposure to the reward, the level of euphoria he achieves starts to come down, and therefore he needs more substance to be achieve the same level of euphoria. <br><br>
                Individuals are desperate to escape the dysphoric state, so they may start using the substance to get out of the dysphoric state. When he cannot get his hands on the substance, he may get violent and affect those around him.

            <p class = 'bodyText'>Substance use could also be dangerous, because of the danger of the substance itself. A few popular substances and their effect on the body are shown below.</p><br>

            <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'><a href="/substances/marijuana.html" class = 'citations'>Marijuana</a> </b> is one of the more popular substances that are used by adolescents. A recent study by New Zealand showed that heavy marijuana use during the teenage years caused people to lose an average of 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38. For context, an individual with 100 IQ is in the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of people have an IQ lower than 100. However, a loss of just 8 IQ points, resulting in an IQ of 92 in this case, places this individual in the 29th percentile. <sup><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana" class = 'citations'>[7]</a><a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/iq-percentile" class = 'citations'>[8]</a></sup></li><br>

            <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'><a href="/substances/vaping.html" class = 'citations'>Vaping</a></b> is another popular substance, with one in 9 high school seniors using it daily. An FDA study analyzing samples of vapes from two leading brands showed that there are carcinogens (substances that cause cancer) inside of them. Vaping is also a way to inhale nicotine, which is more addictive then heroin and cocaine. Nicotine can also narrow your arteries, meaning blood flow is limited, and eventually may lead to heart attack and death. <sup><a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/emotional-health/vaping-4-risks-for-kids" class = 'citations'>[9]</a></sup></li><br>

            <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'>MDMA (ecstasy or Molly)</b> is a substance that has properties of stimulants (substances that 'wake you up') and hallucinogens (substances that make you see, hear, or feel things that don't exist) properties.

            <p class = 'bodyText'>Let's start with the one of the biggest reasons - <b>peer pressure</b>.<sup><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drug-topics/criminal-justice/science-drug-use-resource-justice-sector" class = 'citations'>[19]</a></sup> The story at the beginning of this page is an example of almost falling for peer pressure. In most cases, friends or people around you may convince you to try a substance for particular reason, often threatening you if you don't. In the story, your friends told you multiple times to vape with them, and when you refused and walked out, some of them teased that they wont be your friend. Common phrases used by people who want you to try some substances may include: </p><br>
                
                    <li class = 'list'>"You're not cool unless you do this with us!"</li>

                    <li class = 'list'>"So and so said that this is safe!"</li>

                <p class = 'imageSubTitle'>One may be tempted to fall into substance use when other people around them are doing it.</p>
                <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Curiosity or boredom</b> may play a role in falling into substance use as well.<sup><a href="https://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/drugs/why-do-people-take-drugs.html">[20]</a></sup> Let's say that there is a movie that came out. Everyone around you is talking about it, saying how good the movie is. You will perhaps get curious about what the movie is like, or what it is about, and therefore will want to watch it. The same thing can go with substances. Even if people around you aren't directly convincing you to try the substance, <b>if they keep telling you how great using the substance feels, you may be curious and be tempted to try the substance on your own to see what it is like. </b><b>Boredom</b> could be a source of curiosity.</p>

                <p class = 'imageSubTitle'>People with boredom may have a risk of falling into substance use, especially if they want to try something new.</p>
                <p class = 'bodyText'> Another reason why one may fall into substance use is because they want to either <b>1) feel better </b>or <b>2) to get out of feeling depressed</b>. Let me ask you directly - what do you do when you are feeling down? Do you listen to music? Play video games? Go for a walk? While all of these options seem pretty normal, unfortunately this is not the case with some people. People may turn to substances when they are feeling down because they know that substances elicit a temporary feeling of euphoria.</p>
                <p class = 'bodyText'><b>Let's talk role models.</b> All of us have definitely had a role model from time to time, whether it is our parents, a teacher, an older brother, or a close friend. When you have a role model, you are most likely to pay attention to their actions and will probably want to copy them to look 'cool'. This means that if someone you look up to uses a substance, you may most likely want to imitate whatever they are doing. This ties in with the previous point as well; if someone you look up to uses a substance just to get out of feeling 'down,' you may want to do so as well.</p>
                <p class = 'bodyText'><b>The environment. </b>One may turn to substances if the environment around them is harsh; perhaps one's parents keep fighting, or just recently divorced. To escape the pain, turning to substances may be the only option that one canthink of. People may also use substances to rebel against their parents, because of the suffering that he or she went through because of them. <sup><a href="https://www.newportacademy.com/resources/substance-abuse/reasons-teens-use-drugs/" class = 'citations'>[21]</a></sup></p><hr>
